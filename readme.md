# Data Quality Analysis Repository

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive data quality analysis pipeline for fictitious healthcare data. It includes exploratory analysis, anomaly detection, and validation using advanced machine learning techniques. The project was built to showcase best practices in data validation and anomaly detection workflows.

## Features

1. **Data Quality Report**:
   - Detailed profiling of columns (e.g., data types, missing values, unique values, statistical summaries).
   - Validation rules with anomaly detection using Isolation Forest and K-Means clustering.

2. **Interactive Visualization**:
   - A web-based report (`data_quality_report.html`) styled with `styles.css` for easy navigation and insights.
   - Includes visualizations for missing values and suggestions for data imputation.

3. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - `Data_Quality_Validator.ipynb` contains the codebase for profiling, anomaly detection, and report generation.

4. **Synthetic Healthcare Data**:
   - Provided in `synthetic_healthcare_data.csv` for replicable demonstrations.

5. **PDF Documentation**:
   - `data_quality_report.pdf` serves as an offline version of the data quality report.

## Repository Structure
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Open `Data_Quality_Validator.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Execute the cells to profile the data and detect anomalies.

2. **View the Report**:
   - Open `data_quality_report.html` in a web browser to explore the interactive report.
   - The report is styled using `styles.css` for clarity and readability.
   - Alternatively, [go here](https://glistening-gingersnap-6dd4b2.netlify.app/) and preview a live hosted version of the report.

3. **Review Offline**:
   - Open `data_quality_report.pdf` to access the data quality report without running the code.

4. **Dataset**:
   - `synthetic_healthcare_data.csv` is used for demonstrations and can be replaced with real datasets.
